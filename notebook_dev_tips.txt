Compared to some other document formats, my impression of the the
.ipynb notebook format so far is that it is quite amenable to being
subject to version control. Not only is it a text-based format, but it
is a particularly clean text-based format, with very little in the way
of internal fields to keep track of the state of the GUI, that kind of
thing. Most of the data in the notebook is things that you put there.

This means that, when you use a text-based comparison tool like diff(1)
to see what has changed between two versions of a notebook, most of
what you see will indeed be worth seeing.

There is just one thing I found to help keep the notebooks
as clean as possible before committing them to a Git repo:
invoke the “Cell → All Output → Clear” menu item. This gets rid of
cached graphics generated by cell code. No point saving them in the
repo, when they can be regenerated so easily, and when they could
be the source of spurious differences.

Older versions of IPython also added a “signature” entry to the
notebook, which had to be removed. But it seems that is obsolete
now.

This repository contains [IPython](http://ipython.org) notebooks using Python code to explain various concepts to do with the [Cairo](http://cairographics.org/) 2D graphics library. Cairo calls are made using the [Qahirah](https://github.com/ldo/qahirah) high-level binding for Python 3. Several of the figures can be interactively animated.

If you are new to IPython, use the command

> ipython3 notebook

in the current directory to start an IPython session using Python 3. IPython’s mini webserver will listen on port 8888 on your local machine; connect using your web browser to see the available notebooks to open them and start interacting with them. In particular, click in a code cell and press shift-enter to execute the code. The code cells in these notebooks are designed to be executed in sequence. Or, if you’re lazy, you can do “Cell → Run All” when you open a notebook.

More information is available via the Help menu in the notebook browser window.
